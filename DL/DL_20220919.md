Representation Picture
---

### A color image can be encoded
- RGB format(red-green-blue)
- HSV format(hue-saturation-value)
- `"select all red pixels in the image" is simpler in the RGB format`
- `"make the image less saturated" is simpler in the HSV format`

----

Machine-Learning models
---

1. Raw Data
2. Coordinate Change
3. Better Representation

`x-axis & y-axis translation`

### Learning

#### Learning, in the context of machine learning

### The "deep" in "deep learning"

- Deep Learning
`puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations`
- Depth
`How many layers contribute to a model of the data is called the depth of the model`
- Modern deep learning often involves
`ten or even hundreds of successive layers of representations`


Face Recognition using Deep Networks
---

- Patterns of Local Contrast 
`(Input Layer)`
- Face Features 
`(Hidden Layer 1)`
- Face 
`(Hidden Layer 2)`
- Output Layer
